### Ciao 👋

#### Welcome to my Github Profile

#### *I enjoy creating programs that relate to music 🎹, mathematics 📖 and language ✏️* 

Here is a collection of my computer science projects, ideas and notes. Data-science and cryptography are also interests of mine and consequently, repositories for these categories have been created.
