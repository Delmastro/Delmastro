## ✨ *Welcome to my Github Profile* ✨

### I enjoy developing new tools that make learning easy and fun. <br />

<br>
Here is a collection of my projects, ideas and notes. I love designing experiences that resonant with users that assit them with learning new concepts. My other interests are pattern recognition 🔍 cryptography 📖 and mathematics ✏️<br />

<br>
🔭 I’m currently polishing my web design and development skills.<br />
<br>
🎹 I enjoy creating my own music and improvising along to jazz fusion in my spare time <br />
