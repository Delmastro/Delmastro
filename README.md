### Ciao 👋

#### ✨ *Welcome to my Github Profile* ✨

#### *I enjoy developing new tools that make learning easy and fun.* <br />


Here is a collection of my projects, ideas and notes. I love designing experiences that resonant with users and help them learn new concepts. My other interests are pattern recognition, cryptography 📖 and mathematics ✏️<br />


🔭 I’m currently polishing my web design and development skills.<br />

🎹 I enjoy creating my own music and improvising along to jazz legends in my spare time <br />
